<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<h4>“Attendance Management System” is software developed for
    maintaining the attendance of the student on the daily basis in
    the collage. Here the staffs, who are handling the subjects, will
    be responsible to mark the attendance of the students. Each staff
    will be given with a separate username and password based on the
    subject they handle. An accurate report based on the student
    attendance is generated here. This system will also help in
    evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Report
    of the student’s attendance on weekly and monthly basis is generated.</h4>
